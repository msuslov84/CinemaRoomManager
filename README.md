## CinemaRoomManager
### About:
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way 
to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can 
get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, I've created an application that 
helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and 
more.
### Description:
This small project from JetBrains Academy is a good opportunity to work with input and output 
in Java. I've dealt with arrays and functions as well as loops and conditional statements. Also
I've used JUnit library for checking and controlling correct perfomance.
### Launch example:
* java -jar CinemaRoomManager.jar
### Technical information:
* Версия Java 8 (Oracle OpenJDK version 1.8.0_311)
* Библиотека JUnit 4.13.2
