### About:
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way 
to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can 
get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, I've created an application that 
helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and 
more.
### Description:
This small project from JetBrains Academy is a good opportunity to work with input and output 
in Java. I've dealt with arrays and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.
